# Australian Bushfire Data Explorer

## About This App

This interactive application explores two important types of data related to Australian bushfires:

### 1. Temperature Anomaly Data

-   **Description**: Shows deviations from long-term average temperatures.

-   **Implication**: Positive anomalies indicate warmer than average conditions, associated with increased bushfire risk.

-   **Data Source**: NASA GISS surface temperature analysis

### 2. Fire Weather Index (FWI) Data

-   **Description**: A comprehensive indicator for assessing fire risk.

-   **Implication**: Considers multiple factors including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

-   **Risk Levels**:

-   0-3: Low risk

-   3-7: Moderate risk

-   7-10: High risk

-   10+: Very high risk

## Key Features

-   **Data Exploration**: Dynamically select datasets and time ranges.

-   **Visualization**: Display data trends using various chart types.

-   **Statistical Analysis**: Provides detailed descriptive statistics.

-   **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing the Relationship Between Temperature Anomalies and Fire Risk

## How to Use

1.  Select the dataset you want to analyze (temperature anomaly or FWI)

2.  Adjust the time range and other parameters

3.  Switch between different tabs to obtain different types of information

## Data Interpretation

### Temperature Anomalies

-   Long-term upward trends may indicate global warming

-   Seasonal patterns reflect natural climate cycles

-   Extreme positive values ​​may be associated with heat waves and drought conditions

### FWI Index

-   High values ​​indicate favorable weather conditions for fires

-   Persistently high values ​​may indicate an extended fire season

-   Peak values ​​are associated with extreme fire weather events
